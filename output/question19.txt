Question : If so, please give an example:

- Une personne qui télécharge les documents et qui participe à des tests ne veut pas forcément dire qu'il travaille en cours
- A student never goes to a course but that doesn't mean he/she didn't understand it, especially if she/he attended lectures.
- We download or print documents so we don't revize on Umtice
- a deconnexion during a quizz
- If I try several times a quizz, that may be because of internet connexion or bugs on my devices.
- Some students could just open courses and not read them to fake datas
- time spent on a page is not representative the time we actually work
